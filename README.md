Want to use AI with your Kite trading account? 

**Easiest**: Install our [Claude Desktop Extension](https://github.com/zerodha/kite-mcp-server/releases) - One-click install, no configuration needed!

**Alternative**: Add `https://mcp.kite.trade/mcp` to your AI client configuration. No installation or API keys required - it's hosted and ready to use.

## Features

- **Claude Desktop Extension**: One-click installation with local execution for maximum security
- **Portfolio Management**: View holdings, positions, margins, and mutual fund investments
- **Order Management**: Place, modify, and cancel orders with full order history
- **GTT Orders**: Good Till Triggered order management
- **Market Data Access**: Real-time quotes, historical data, OHLC data
- **Pagination Support**: Automatic pagination for large datasets (holdings, orders, trades)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Implements most Kite Connect API endpoints
- **Multiple Deployment Modes**: stdio, HTTP, SSE, and hybrid mode (production)
- **Built-in Documentation**: Auto-served documentation at runtime

## Quick Start

### Hosted Version (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with our hosted version at `mcp.kite.trade`. Both `/mcp` and `/sse` endpoints are available - no installation or API keys required on your end.

**Quick Setup:** Add the following to your MCP configuration:

```
https://mcp.kite.trade/mcp
```

**Recommended:** Use the new HTTP mode (`/mcp` endpoint) for better performance and reliability. You can use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-remote) to connect to the hosted server.

For self-hosting with your own API keys, follow the installation steps below.

### Prerequisites

- **For hosted version (recommended)**: Nothing! Just use `https://mcp.kite.trade/mcp`
- **For self-hosting**: Go 1.21 or later
- **For self-hosting**: Valid Kite Connect API credentials

### Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zerodha/kite-mcp-server
cd kite-mcp-server
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Kite Connect credentials:

```env
KITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
KITE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
APP_MODE=http
APP_PORT=8080
APP_HOST=localhost
```

You can also use the provided `justfile` to initialize the config.

```bash
just init-env
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Build and run
go build -o kite-mcp-server
./kite-mcp-server

# Or run directly
go run main.go
```

The server will start and serve a status page at `http://localhost:8080/`

"Place a market order for 100 shares of TCS"
"Show my trading history for today"
```

The extension provides access to all Kite Connect features including portfolio management, market data, order execution, and GTT orders.

### Claude Desktop (Hosted Mode)

For the hosted version, add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.kite.trade/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop (HTTP Mode)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8080/mcp", "--allow-http"],
      "env": {
        "APP_MODE": "http",
        "KITE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "KITE_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop (SSE Mode)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8080/sse", "--allow-http"],
      "env": {
        "APP_MODE": "sse",
        "KITE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "KITE_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop (stdio Mode)

For self-hosted installations, you must first build the binary:

```bash
go build -o kite-mcp-server
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kite": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/your/kite-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "APP_MODE": "stdio",
        "KITE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "KITE_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Use the full absolute path to your built binary. For example:

- `/home/username/kite-mcp-server/kite-mcp-server` (Linux)
- `/Users/username/kite-mcp-server/kite-mcp-server` (macOS)
- `C:\Users\username\kite-mcp-server\kite-mcp-server.exe` (Windows)

### Other MCP Clients

For other MCP-compatible clients, use the hosted endpoint `https://mcp.kite.trade/mcp` with [mcp-remote](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-remote) or configure your client to connect directly to the HTTP endpoint.

## Development

### Development Environment

This project includes a Nix flake for consistent development environments:

```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Or with direnv
direnv allow
```

### Using Just Commands

Install [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for convenient development commands:

```bash
just build      # Build the project
just run        # Run the server
just test       # Run tests
just lint       # Format and lint code
just coverage   # Generate coverage report

# Desktop Extension Development
just build-extension      # Build cross-platform extension binaries
just package-extension    # Package extension as .dxt file
just release-extension    # Create automated release with extension
```

### Running Tests

**Requirements:**

- Go 1.23+ with `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest` (required for timing-dependent tests)

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# With coverage
just coverage

# With race detector
just test-race

# Direct go command (if you prefer)
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOEXPERIMENT=synctest go test -v ./...
```

#### Synctest Integration

This project requires Go's `synctest` package for time-dependent tests (session expiry, clock skew tolerance). All timing tests use `synctest.Run()` for:

- **Fast execution**: Time-dependent tests complete in milliseconds instead of minutes
- **Deterministic timing**: No flaky timing-based test failures
- **Controlled time**: Tests can advance time without actual delays

The justfile automatically includes `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest` in all test commands.

## Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Default     | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KITE_API_KEY`       | Required    | Your Kite Connect API key                                  |
| `KITE_API_SECRET`    | Required    | Your Kite Connect API secret                               |
| `APP_MODE`           | `http`      | Server mode: `stdio`, `http`, `sse`, or `hybrid`           |
| `APP_PORT`           | `8080`      | Server port (HTTP/SSE/hybrid modes)                        |
| `APP_HOST`           | `localhost` | Server host (HTTP/SSE/hybrid modes)                        |
| `EXCLUDED_TOOLS`     | _(empty)_   | Comma-separated list of tools to exclude from registration |

**Note:** In production, we use hybrid mode which supports both `/sse` and `/mcp` endpoints, making both HTTP and SSE protocols available for different client needs.

### Tool Exclusion

You can exclude specific tools by setting the `EXCLUDED_TOOLS` environment variable with a comma-separated list of tool names. This is useful for creating read-only instances.

**Example:**

```env
EXCLUDED_TOOLS=place_order,modify_order,cancel_order
```

The hosted version at `mcp.kite.trade` excludes potentially destructive trading operations for security. For accessing the other operations you can generate your own API keys and run the server locally.
